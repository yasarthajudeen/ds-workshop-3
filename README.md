Decentralized Prediction System - Part 1
This repository contains the code and models for the first part of the decentralized prediction system. Each team member trained a machine learning model on the Iris dataset and created a Flask API to expose their model's predictions.

Team Members
Yasar Thajudeen (KNN Model)
Sandeep Pidugu (Random Forest Model)
Sethulakshmi Kochuchirayil Babu (Naive Bayes Model)
Johnny Paul Edwin (SVM Model)
Part 1: Individual Models and APIs
Objective
Each team member trained a different machine learning model on the Iris dataset and created a Flask API to serve predictions. The models include:

KNN Model (Yasar Thajudeen)
Random Forest Model (Sandeep Pidugu)
Naive Bayes Model (Sethulakshmi Kochuchirayil Babu)
SVM Model (Johnny Paul Edwin)
